Project Title: CMS-Style Blog Site
Overview
This project aims to develop a Content Management System (CMS)-style blog site tailored for developers who write about technology. The site will allow users to publish articles, blog posts, and share their thoughts and opinions. It will feature a user-friendly interface, including a homepage showcasing existing blog posts, navigation links, and login options.

Features
Homepage
Initial Visit: Users are greeted with the homepage displaying existing blog posts (if any), navigation links for the homepage and dashboard, and an option to log in.
Navigation Links: Clicking on the homepage link takes users back to the homepage. Other navigation links prompt users to sign up or sign in.
Authentication
Sign Up: New users are prompted to create a username and password upon choosing to sign up. Their credentials are saved, and they are logged into the site.
Sign In: Returning users are prompted to enter their username and password. Upon successful authentication, they are directed to the site's main features.
Dashboard
View Posts: Signed-in users can access their dashboard to view any blog posts they have created.
Add New Post: Users can add a new blog post by entering a title and content. This action saves the post and updates the dashboard.
Edit/Delete Posts: Existing posts can be edited or deleted directly from the dashboard, reflecting changes immediately.
Comments
Comment Submission: Users can leave comments on blog posts. Comments are saved, and the post is updated to display the comment along with the commenter's username and date created.
Security
Idle Timeout: After being idle on the site for more than a set time, users are prompted to log in again before they can add, update, or delete posts.

Homepage Display: On initial visit, the homepage presents existing blog posts, navigation links, and a login option.
Authentication Flow: Users can sign up, sign in, and are authenticated to access site features.
Dashboard Functionality: Users can view, add, edit, and delete blog posts from the dashboard.
